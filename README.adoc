= Flexible Upstream Docker Image for Centos 7

This create a base image that can be used in build environments with different requirements.

== Use Case

Docker projects (other than this) shall build both in a standard environment with a direct internet connection
and in a restricted environment with proxy access to whitelisted repositories.

== Solution

Create and maintain an image tag that will point to either the upstream centos:7 (i.e., docker.io/library/centos:7),
or to a local image that has modified URLs for YUM repos etc.

== Usage

Reference this image in the downstream project's Dockerfile FROM clause.

Create a Jenkins job that will update the tag on a regular basis (e.g. daily).
